I'm a software engineer.

I enjoy creating software.

My passion is to apply my expertise and to learn new technologies to develop
the best software.

I like fast-paced environments and can switch among various roles. I look for
thoroughness, organization, and excellence in the definition and designs of new
ideas and their practical implementation with solutions based on reality.
